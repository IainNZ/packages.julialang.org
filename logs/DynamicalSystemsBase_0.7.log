INFO: ~~~ DifferentialEquations.jl *BREAKING* changes  ~~~

We have changed the front-end API on how
users may define equations of motion and 
problems, for all problem types that can
be used in the DifferentialEquations.jl.
These are *BREAKING* changes, and they
also have *NO WARNINGS*!

Please see our latest documentation here:
http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/

or the blogpost that describes the changes:
http://juliadiffeq.org/2018/01/24/Parameters.html

In short, the mutated argument is the first argument,
and parameters are now directly passed
into the equations of motion function. For all
types now mutation goes first, then dependent variables, 
then parameters, then independent variables. 

`f(mutated, dependent variables, p/integrator, independent variables)`

For example, this means that the ODE syntax will be `f(u,p,t)` (for the
out-of-place) and `f(du,u,p,t)` (for the in-place). Notice
that this change also removes the need for ParameterizedFunctions
as now parameters are part of the equations of motion.

For more details please visit the above links!

INFO: ~~~ DynamicalSystemsBase.jl update message ~~~

We have changed the fundamental way users define
equations of motion and Jacobians
for all subtypes of `DynamicalSystem`!
In short, parameters are now directly passed
into the equations of motion function, e.g.
`f(du, u, p, t)`. These updates are in-line
with DifferentialEquations v4.0 release.

Notice that the same changes happened for
discrete systems as well. For example, the
e.o.m. for `DiscreteDS` are now expected
in the form `eom(x, p)`.

Please see the documentation strings of the system types you are using!

Also, be sure to visit the updated documentation here:
