[model] Performance warnings
WARNING: The addition operator has been used on JuMP expressions a large number of times. This warning is safe to ignore but may indicate that model generation is slower than necessary. For performance reasons, you should not add expressions in a loop. Instead of x += y, use append!(x,y) to modify x in place. If y is a single variable, you may also use push!(x, coef, y) in place of x += coef*y.
