┌ Warning: The syntax `.'` for transposition is deprecated, and the special lowering of `.'` in multiplication (`*`), left-division (`\`), and right-division (`/`) operations, for example `A.'*B` lowering to `At_mul_B(A, B)`, `A\B.'` lowering to `A_ldiv_Bt(A, B)`, and `A.'/B.'` lowering to `At_rdiv_Bt(A, B)`, has been removed in favor of a lazy `Transpose` wrapper type and dispatch on that type. Two rewrites for `A.'` for matrix `A` exist: eager or materializing `transpose(A)`, which constructs a freshly allocated matrix of `A`'s type and containing the transpose of `A`, and lazy `Transpose(A)`, which wraps `A` in a `Transpose` view type. Which rewrite is appropriate depends on context: If `A.'` appears in a multiplication, left-division, or right-division operation that was formerly specially lowered to an `A_mul_B`-like call, then the lazy `Tranpose(A)` is the correct replacement and will result in dispatch to a method equivalent to the former `A_mul_B`-like call. For example, `A.'*B`, formerly yielding `At_mul_B(A, B)`, should be rewritten `Transpose(A)*B`, which will dispatch to a method equivalent to the former `At_mul_B(A, B)` method. If `A.'` appears outside such an operation, then `transpose(A)` is the correct rewrite. For vector `A`, `A.'` already transposed lazily to a `RowVector`, so `Transpose(A)`. which now yields a `Transpose`-wrapped vector behaviorally equivalent to the former `RowVector` is always the correct rewrite for vectors. For more information, see issue #5332 on Julia's issue tracker on GitHub.
