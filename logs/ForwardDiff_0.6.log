Error During Test
  Test threw an exception of type MethodError
  Expression: ForwardDiff.jacobian(diff, sx) == actual
  MethodError: Cannot `convert` an object of type Int64 to an object of type ForwardDiff.Dual{ForwardDiff.Tag{Base.LinAlg.#diff,0x28ca5acfd15b108e},Float64,9}
  The applicable method may be too new: running in world age 21810, while current world is 21904.
  This may have arisen from a call to the constructor ForwardDiff.Dual{ForwardDiff.Tag{Base.LinAlg.#diff,0x28ca5acfd15b108e},Float64,9}(...),
  since type constructors fall back to convert methods.
