CondaHTTPError: HTTP 522 None
for url <None>

An remote server error occurred when trying to retrieve this URL.

A 500-type error (e.g. 500, 501, 502, 503, etc.) indicates the server failed to
fulfill a valid request.  The problem may be spurious, and will resolve itself if you
try your request again.  If the problem persists, consider notifying the maintainer
of the remote server.
