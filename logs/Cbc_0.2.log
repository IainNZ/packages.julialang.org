Testing mixintprog with solver CbcSolver
Done
Welcome to the CBC MILP Solver 
Version: 2.8.8 
Build Date: Aug  8 2014 

command line - CoinMP -solve -quit (default strategy 1)
Continuous objective value is -16.5 - 0.00 seconds
Cgl0004I processed model has 1 rows, 5 columns (5 integer) and 5 elements
Cutoff increment increased from 1e-05 to 0.9999
Cbc0038I Solution found of -16
Cbc0038I Before mini branch and bound, 4 integers at bound fixed and 0 continuous
Cbc0038I Mini branch and bound did not improve solution (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0038I After 0.00 seconds - Feasibility pump exiting with objective of -16 - took 0.00 seconds
Cbc0012I Integer solution of -16 found by feasibility pump after 0 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0001I Search completed - best objective -16, took 1 iterations and 0 nodes (0.00 seconds)
Cbc0035I Maximum depth 0, 4 variables fixed on reduced cost
Cuts at root node changed objective from -16.5 to -16
Probing was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
Gomory was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
Knapsack was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
Clique was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
MixedIntegerRounding2 was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
FlowCover was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)
TwoMirCuts was tried 0 times and created 0 cuts of which 0 were active after adding rounds of cuts (0.000 seconds)

Result - Optimal solution found

Objective value:                -16.00000000
Enumerated nodes:               0
Total iterations:               1
Time (CPU seconds):             0.00
